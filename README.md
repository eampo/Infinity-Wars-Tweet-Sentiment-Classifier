# linear_algebra
Linear algebra final project - Twitter sentient analysis.

In this project, we are tasked to utilize linear algebra into a project. Our team chose to conduct a sentiment analysis of tweets.  In this project, we show how linear algebra concepts are used in sentiment analysis through the idea of words as vectors.  After pre-processing the tweets using natural language processing techniques, we used a Random Forest model to predict sentiment of a tweet.
